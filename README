Background
----------

This directory hierarchy contains the code which implements 
computation of the associated Legendre functions for integer
only values of the degree and order, which are typically denoted
as "l" and "m" respectively.

Note that the C++11 features in the compiler must be enabled.
The code has been tested with g++ and so the --std=c++0x option 
needs to be used on the compiler line.

NOTE: The test of 2D integrals uses the GNU Scientific Library to 
      perform the quadrature for the inner integral. It will be 
      necessary to install the GSL to compile and link-edit that 
      binary. The Makefile file will need modified to point at the
      GSL.

Directory structure
-------------------

./inc  The C++ templates as described above are located here

./src  A test driver programs which use the templates are placed here

       This driver computes the P_lm and Q_lm and may therefore
       be used to compare with the table of function values 
       reported in the research paper above.

./bin  The binary for the test programs are placed in this location

Compilation
-----------

There is a Makefile at the top level of this directory structure.

All that is required is to change to that directory and to type 

      make

The test binary can then be run by typing, for example 

      ./bin/test2.x
