Background
----------

This directory hierarchy contains the code which implements 
computation of the associated Legendre functions for integer
only values of the degree and order, which are typically denoted
as "l" and "m" respectively. 

The Fortran 90 program published in the paper

   A new Fortran 90 program to compute regular and irregular
   associated Legendre functions

has been converted to C++ templates. These make the type for the
computation selectable at comile time from float, double and 
long double.

Note that the C++11 features in the compiler must be enabled.
The code has been tested with g++ and so the --std=c++0x option 
needs to be used on the compiler line.

Directory structure
-------------------

./inc  The C++ templates as described above are located here

./src  A test driver program which uses the templates is placed here

       This driver computes the P_lm and Q_lm and may therefore
       be used to compare with the table of function values 
       reported in the research paper above.

./bin  The binary for the test program is placed in this location

Compilation
-----------

There is a Makefile at the top level of this directory structure.

All that is rerquired is to type 

      make

The test binary can then be run by typing 

      ./bin/test.x 

Note that the C++11 features in the compiler must be enabled.
The code has been tested with g++ and so the --std=c++0x option
needs to be used on the compiler line.
